[![Watch the demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/RCz6ZBfFdtM/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RCz6ZBfFdtM)


This project uses **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **NumPy** to create a real-time invisibility cloak effect by detecting red-colored regions in a webcam feed and replacing them with a pre-captured background.

---

## 📌 Features

- Real-time video capture using your webcam.
- HSV-based red color detection.
- Morphological operations for mask cleanup.
- Bitwise operations to merge background and live video feed.
- Real-time invisibility illusion using red cloth.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
